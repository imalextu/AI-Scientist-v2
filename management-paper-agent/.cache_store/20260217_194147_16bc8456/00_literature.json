    "abstract": "Abstract With the growing use of artificial intelligence, search engine providers are increasingly pushing advertisers to use automated bidding strategies based on machine learning. Such automated decision‐making systems leave advertisers in the dark about the data being used and how they can influence the outcome of the decision‐making process. Previous literature on artificial intelligence lacks an understanding of the dangers related to artificially intelligent systems and their lack of transparency. In response, our paper addresses the inherent risks of the automated optimization of advertisers' bidding strategies in search engine advertising. The selected empirical case of a service company therefore demonstrates how data availability can trigger a long‐term decline in advertising performance and how search engine advertising performance metrics develop before and after an event of data scarcity. Based on data collected for 525 days, difference‐in‐differences analysis shows that the algorithmic approach has a considerable and lasting negative impact on advertising performance. Furthermore, the empirical case indicates that self‐regulated learning can initialize a downward spiral that gradually impairs advertising performance. Thus, the aim of this study is to increase awareness regarding automated decision‐making dangers in search engine advertising and help advertisers take preventive measures to reduce the risks of algorithm missteps.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) advertising, or intelligent advertising in short, is a generic term for various forms of brand communication powered by AI technologies. It represents the latest development of digital advertising, which has evolved from interactive advertising to programmatic advertising to intelligent advertising since the 1990s. Advertising today is viewed broadly as brand communication that embraces both paid and non-paid, as well as brand-initiated and consumer-initiated communication about products, services, and ideas. AI is a science that studies and develops the theory, methodology, technology, and application systems for simulating, extending, and expanding human intelligence. It has been increasingly used in brand communication recently, resulting in the rise of a new discipline of intelligent advertising.",
