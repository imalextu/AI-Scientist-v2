    "abstract": "Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, followed by Microsoft’s announcement of its artificial intelligence (AI)–powered new Bing search engine on February 7, 2023, and Google’s Bard release on March 21, 2023, it seems AI generally has taken over conversations across all sectors of society. In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described “decision support systems” (i.e., expert systems) as probably the “most widely implemented and well-known applications of AI” (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as “brand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both” (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising “situated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising” (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, “Big Data for Advertising Research and Education,” and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, “The Future of Advertising—Will We Be Replaced by Robots?” in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers’ roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains",

    "authors": "Tarun Gupta, Supriya Bansal",
    "year": "2025",
    "venue": "Journal of Marketing & Supply Chain Management",
    "abstract": "This research describes the technology that generative artificial intelligence (AI) is using in search advertising, as well as Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE), Bing Copilot, and conversational services such as ChatGPT and Perplexity AI. To explore a qualitative analysis approach, it examines the shift from the search engine results pages to AI-produced summaries, conversational responses, and multimodal interfaces between text, image, and voice. It focuses on the AI-Integrated Search Marketing Model, which describes how to design conversational ads, predict audience targeting, and adaptive bidding in real-time AI environments. Studies indicate that generative AI reduces organic visibility and provides a more participatory discovery by enhancing engagement-based knowledge, and marketers also need to prioritize semantic relevance, contextual authenticity, and multimodal creativity. As the paper concludes, the future of search advertising needs to incorporate AI-driven personalization with ethical and transparent marketing practices. The recommendations are for continued adaptation to increasingly dynamic conversational and multimodal search environments.",

    "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Framework with Comparative Analysis for SEO and Voice Search Optimization in Digital Marketing",
    "authors": "Vikash Kumar, Parampreet Kaur, V. P. Mishra",
    "year": "2025",
    "venue": "2025 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE)",
    "abstract": "In digital marketing, the result of artificial intelligence (AI) could provide the optimization of visibility and engagement that can change the whole perspective of business model. Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on one of the most advanced and adaptive AI methods and thus it is suitable for search engine optimization (SEO) and voice search optimization (VSO). In contrast to conventional SEO that uses static keyword and ranking policies, RL uses feedback through click through rates, dwell time and user behavior to optimize optimization policies as time progresses. Equally, VSO, formed by conversational, intent-directed queries, has its own set of distinct challenges which RL can surmount via the continuous modification of voice pattern and context-based search behaviors. The paper will overview historical literature in the fields of RL, AI-based search engine optimization practices, and the latest research in the field of VSO, and then will compile their overlaps into a conceptual framework. Through comparative analysis of existing approaches, identification of gaps in research and the future prospects of the research, the study outlines the possibility of RL to support more personalized, ethical, and sustainable digital marketing practices. The results suggest that RL-based SEO and VSO, strategies can offer more flexibility, resistance to the changes in the algorithms, and competitive edge to the marketers in the digital ecosystems that are more voice-controlled. The comparison results show a tendency in frontier knowledge toward expert reinforcement learning, SEO, or voice search optimization studies becoming more integrated with each other. Although this article is conceptual in nature, it does provide both a formalized analytical framework as well as comparisons to guide future empirical work. This paper highlights testable deficiencies particularly in adaptivity, likeability and ethical motivational strategies and also it offers theoretical opportunities for filling in some of the gaps.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the transformation of approaches to search engine optimization (SEO) in the context of the rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into the digital information space. Traditional SEO, which focuses mainly on improving website visibility in search engines like Google, is gradually losing its dominant role. This shift is driven by changes in user behavior and the growing influence of AI-based assistants such as ChatGPT, xAI, Gemini, and similar tools. The research highlights how generative AI models are becoming primary sources of information for users, replacing standard search engines in many situations. As a result, businesses, content creators, and digital marketers must adapt their optimization strategies to ensure their content is accessible, relevant, and useful for AI-driven systems. Unlike traditional SEO, which relies heavily on keywords, backlinks, and search engine algorithms, the new approach must consider how AI models process, rank, and generate responses based on existing digital content. The paper argues for the need to develop a new set of optimization practices — referred to as AIO (Artificial Intelligence Optimization) — which would complement traditional SEO techniques. AIO focuses on structuring content in a way that improves its visibility and usability for generative AI tools. This includes writing clear and informative text, using structured data, and ensuring factual accuracy, as AI models prioritize well-organized and reliable sources. Furthermore, the study outlines key differences between SEO and AIO and proposes recommendations for integrating AIO strategies into existing content workflows. By combining SEO with AIO, organizations can increase their chances of being featured not only in search engine results but also in AI-generated responses.",

    "venue": "ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship",
    "abstract": "This study systematically investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) enhances market competitiveness through its application in search engine optimization (SEO) and digital marketing strategies within e-commerce environments. In an increasingly saturated and algorithm-driven digital marketplace, firms are under continuous pressure to improve visibility, personalization, and customer engagement. The research followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure a transparent and rigorous review process. A total of 112 peer-reviewed articles, published between 2012 and 2025, were selected and analyzed across five major academic databases and relevant grey literature. The findings reveal that AI technologies—such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotic process automation, and predictive analytics—are instrumental in transforming traditional marketing workflows across the entire digital funnel. AI-powered SEO tools significantly improve organic reach, technical site health, and semantic keyword alignment. Concurrently, predictive personalization and lifecycle-based automation enhance customer retention, conversion, and lifetime value. The review also highlights AI’s impact on social media intelligence, influencer marketing optimization, and attribution modeling, all of which contribute to improved ROI and operational efficiency. Longitudinal evidence from multiple industries—specially fashion, electronics, and healthcare—demonstrates that sustained AI adoption leads to compounding strategic advantages, including innovation capacity, brand loyalty, and agility in response to market shifts. By synthesizing empirical findings and industry case applications, this study positions AI not merely as a technological enhancement but as a core strategic capability that redefines digital competitiveness in e-commerce. The results offer both scholars and practitioners a comprehensive understanding of how AI can be systematically leveraged to achieve differentiation, efficiency, and sustainable growth in the evolving digital economy.",

    "abstract": "n Hungary, 94% of businesses have Internet access and 63% have a website. Moreover, online retail sales will reach HUF 1,203 billion in 2021. In order for companies to achieve the largest possible market share, they can use various digital marketing strategies. They are distinguished according to different methods. One of the most commonly used in practice and in science is inbound (as search engine optimization) and outbound (as advertising). Google Ads, which emerged at the turn of the millennium and defined itself as the world’s first company to use machine learning technology, is a market leader. Their ad system was initially based on keywords, which have since been expanded to include more than 4,800 types of targeting criteria. These targeting options are available for a variety of ad formats. The digital solutions to the billboards of traditional marketing are banner ads, called Display on Google. These ads contain image, video, and text content and aim to interrupt the consumer’s activity and redirect them to the advertiser’s website. Since they are capable of increasing website traffic by up to 300%, this can be interpreted as an opportunity that is also considered favorable by businesses. It is also suitable for testing various content elements, as one of its main indicators, the click-through rate, expresses the relevance of the ad, as several researchers have noted. As the role of artificial intelligence grows, more and more companies are using it as a competitive advantage. Some of their algorithms are capable of generating text, images, videos, or other content. In this study, I leverage the power of display ads and conduct my research in the Google Ads system instead of conducting consumer surveys. I created two ads for the same target audience, with the same budget and settings. The text content for one ad was created by a marketer, the image content was created by a professional photographer, and the content elements for the other ad were provided by Artificial Intelligence. The objective of the article is to study the performance, efficiency, and impact of artificial intelligence-generated content on conversions under real market conditions. The study also includes content created by the players.",

    "venue": "Corporate Communications. An International Journal",
    "abstract": "PurposeThis study aims to enhance the performance of direct marketing advertising campaigns by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. With direct marketing increasingly used by banks, insurance companies and retail industries, the study proposes a machine learning-based approach to improve targeting accuracy and campaign efficiency.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed methodology integrates the Random Forest classification technique with the Gravity Search Algorithm (GSA) for feature selection. The research is based on the Bank Direct Marketing dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning models to optimize the predictive accuracy of customer responses. The performance of the proposed system is benchmarked against other machine learning models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) and Decision Tree (DT), using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as evaluation metrics. The implementation is conducted using Python in the Google Colab environment.FindingsThe results demonstrate that the hybrid approach of Random Forest and GSA outperforms other traditional machine learning methods in terms of classification accuracy. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.43%, significantly improving prediction performance for direct marketing responses. The integration of GSA effectively reduced data dimensionality by selecting the most relevant features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency and increasing classification precision.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the field of AI-driven marketing by demonstrating the efficacy of a novel hybrid approach in direct marketing. Unlike traditional marketing strategies that rely on broad audience outreach, this research provides a data-driven methodology for precise customer targeting. The findings have practical implications for marketers and organizations aiming to improve the efficiency and profitability of their direct marketing campaigns. Additionally, this research highlights the role of feature selection optimization in enhancing machine learning performance, providing a framework that can be extended to other domains within predictive analytics.",

    "venue": "Universal Library of Innovative Research and Studies",
    "abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of automated keyword selection techniques in Amazon Advertising that leverage artificial intelligence. It evaluates native tools—Search Term Report and Brand Analytics—as well as third-party services, identifying their limitations. Contemporary AI approaches are classified into three categories: natural language processing models (word2vec, BERT), clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN), and predictive analytics methods (Random Forest, XGBoost). Building on this analysis, a dynamic optimization cycle—generation, testing, evaluation, retraining—is proposed to enable real-time model adaptation. The study’s novel contribution lies in the development of a unified taxonomy of AI methods for Amazon Advertising and an empirical comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The results equip small and medium-sized enterprises with strategies to allocate advertising budgets more efficiently and respond swiftly to shifts in consumer demand. Researchers in computational advertising management, particularly those working on semantic analysis and machine-learning-based campaign optimization, will find the classification and performance insights valuable. Digital marketing and e-commerce analytics professionals aiming to integrate advanced AI tools for improved targeting and budget management in Amazon Advertising will also benefit from these findings.",

    "authors": "Suying Huang, Yushi Jiang",
    "year": "2025",
    "venue": "Journal of Consumer Behaviour",
    "abstract": "With the continuous reshaping of digital marketing by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), understanding how AI‐generated advertising can optimize the responses of consumers is critical for businesses. As GenAI evolves from unimodal models to multimodal models that jointly process texts, images, and audios, the literature still lacks a systematic comparison of their advertising effectiveness. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring the types of products to which unimodal and multimodal GenAI are applicable, and the underlying psychological mechanisms, respectively. A study of real‐world data demonstrates that multimodal AI‐generated advertisements are more suitable for experience products. Two online studies show that the perceived immersion of consumers can be enhanced by the integration of multimodal AI‐generated advertisements with experience products, which thereby generate favorable marketing outcomes. Conversely, the cognitive load of consumers can be reduced by combining unimodal AI‐generated content with search products, which thus strengthens their purchase intentions. This research proposes a modality‐product type matching effect and extends the existing research stream on the application of GenAI in advertising. It further provides marketers and advertisers with reliable strategies for leveraging GenAI.",

    "authors": "Volodymyr Voloboiev",
    "year": "2025",
    "venue": "Marketing and Digital Technologies",
    "abstract": "The article aims to investigate the transformation of digital presence architecture under the growing influence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and to develop a basis for adapting marketing strategies in algorithmically mediated environments. Analysis results. The study introduces the concept of digital presence as a dynamic architecture composed of five interdependent components: owned media, social media, earned/shared media, paid media, and the AI-generated content environment. These elements no longer function as discrete channels but as nodes within a real-time, algorithm-driven ecosystem. GenAI transforms the logic of digital presence from deliberate messaging to context-aware synthesis, whereby brand narratives are assembled probabilistically and conversationally based on prior data, user intent, and semantic structure. A key finding of the study is that generative AI, particularly through large language models (LLMs), alters the content discovery process by repositioning itself as the user’s primary interface with the digital environment. This change undermines the efficacy of traditional search and advertising strategies and demands a new paradigm centered on algorithmic compatibility. In this context, the research describes Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) – a strategy aimed at increasing a brand’s algorithmic visibility through semantically structured and machine-readable content. Unlike traditional SEO, GEO focuses on enhancing the likelihood of being included in synthesized AI outputs, often without explicit attribution. The study further reveals that visibility in GenAI environments is contingent upon the brand’s ability to provide content that aligns with the interpretive logic of LLMs. This includes adopting a modular content architecture, using domain-relevant terminology, maintaining tone neutrality, and ensuring semantic coherence. The distinction between digital identity – the intended representation curated by the organization and digital brand image – the perception constructed through AI responses and user interactions – is particularly emphasized. The discrepancy between these two layers can critically affect brand recognition in AI-mediated environments, making the coherence of both human- and machine-facing representations a core strategic issue. The research also outlines the role of AI-generated content as a new layer of communication infrastructure. Generative models often act as intermediaries between users and brands, filtering, restructuring, or even replacing original messaging with system-generated interpretations. As such, digital presence becomes a co-constructed outcome of algorithmic aggregation, user interaction, and the strategic positioning of content across data ecosystems. The study incorporates recent empirical data showing changes in click-through behavior, declining effectiveness of paid ads, and rising user reliance on generative tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini for decision-making. These dynamics reinforce the conclusion that brand communication must now function within a hybrid regime of human and artificial interpretation.",

    "venue": "Italian Journal of Marketing",
    "abstract": "Chatbots are technological tools equipped with artificial intelligence that allow companies to interact with their consumers. Through their computers or mobile devices, consumers can use this technology to search for information, make purchases or request after-sales services. This study aims to identify the role of attitude toward chatbots and privacy concern in the relationship between attitude toward mobile advertising and behavioral intent to use chatbots. After reviewing the literature, the study proposes a moderated mediation model. Through a survey, the study shows that attitude toward mobile advertising does not have a direct effect on the behavioral intent to use chatbot, but is rather mediated by one’s attitude toward chatbots. In fact, the interactivity is unidirectional in the case of mobile advertising (from the company to the consumer), but bidirectional in the case of chatbots (in which consumers have an active role in communication). In line with these assumptions, the data analysis shows that internet privacy concerns only negatively moderate the relationship between attitude toward chatbots and behavioral intent to use this technology. These results can be useful for companies and researchers in terms of developing and testing new digital marketing strategies. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results’ theoretical and managerial implications.",
